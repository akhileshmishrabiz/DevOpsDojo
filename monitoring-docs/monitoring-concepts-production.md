### Storage Strategy by Log Type

```yaml
Log Categories and Storage:
  
  Application Logs:
    Retention: 30 days
    Storage: Loki + S3
    Sampling: 100% for errors, 10% for info
    Cost: ~$0.05/GB
  
  Audit Logs:
    Retention: 7 years
    Storage: CloudWatch → S3 Glacier
    Sampling: Never (compliance)
    Cost: ~$0.004/GB after 90 days
  
  Access Logs:
    Retention: 90 days
    Storage: S3 + Athena
    Sampling: 100%
    Cost: ~$0.023/GB + query costs
  
  Debug Logs:
    Retention: 7 days
    Storage: Loki (no S3)
    Sampling: 1% in production
    Cost: ~$0.01/GB
  
  Security Logs:
    Retention: 1 year
    Storage: CloudWatch + S3
    Sampling: Never
    Cost: ~$0.10/GB (worth the cost)
```

## Cost Analysis Deep Dive

### Real Production Costs - 1000 User SaaS Application

```yaml
Scenario: B2B SaaS with 1000 active users
Traffic: 10M requests/day
Data Generated: 50GB logs/day, 10GB metrics/day

Option 1: Full CloudWatch
  CloudWatch Logs:
    Ingestion: 50GB * 30 * $0.50 = $750/month
    Storage: 1.5TB * $0.03 = $45/month
    Insights: 100GB queries * $0.005 = $0.50/month
  CloudWatch Metrics:
    Custom Metrics: 1000 * $0.30 = $300/month
    API Requests: $10/month
  Container Insights: $50/month
  Total: ~$1,155/month

Option 2: PLG Stack (Recommended)
  Infrastructure:
    3x t3.large for monitoring = $150/month
    EBS Storage (500GB GP3) = $40/month
  Loki Storage (S3):
    1.5TB * $0.023 = $35/month
  Prometheus Storage (EBS):
    300GB * $0.08 = $24/month
  Total: ~$249/month (78% savings)

Option 3: Hybrid Approach
  Critical Logs (CloudWatch): 
    5GB/day * 30 * $0.50 = $75/month
  Bulk Logs (Loki):
    45GB/day → S3 = $31/month
  Metrics (Prometheus): $24/month
  Infrastructure: $150/month
  Total: ~$280/month (76% savings)
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies

```yaml
Quick Wins (Implement Today):
  1. Log Level Filtering:
     Impact: 40-60% reduction
     Implementation: Set production log level to WARN
     Savings: $300-500/month
  
  2. Metric Cardinality Control:
     Impact: 30% reduction in Prometheus memory
     Implementation: Drop unused labels
     Savings: $50-100/month
  
  3. Retention Policies:
     Impact: 50% storage cost reduction
     Implementation: 7d hot, 30d warm, 1y cold
     Savings: $200-300/month

Medium-Term (1-3 months):
  1. Log Sampling:
     Implementation: Sample 10% of INFO logs
     Savings: $200-400/month
  
  2. Metric Aggregation:

## Production Patterns

### Pattern 1: Multi-Tenant Monitoring

```yaml
Architecture:
  Prometheus Federation:
    Central Prometheus:
      - Aggregates metrics from tenant Prometheus
      - Long-term storage
      - Global views
    
    Tenant Prometheus:
      - Namespace-scoped
      - Local storage (1d)
      - Tenant isolation

Implementation:
  # Central Prometheus Config
  global:
    external_labels:
      cluster: 'central'
      replica: '1'
  
  scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'federate'
    scrape_interval: 30s
    honor_labels: true
    metrics_path: '/federate'
    params:
      'match[]':
        - '{job=~".*"}'
    static_configs:
    - targets:
      - 'tenant1-prometheus:9090'
      - 'tenant2-prometheus:9090'
```

### Pattern 2: Canary Monitoring

```yaml
Canary Deployment Monitoring:
  Metrics Comparison:
    - Compare canary vs stable metrics
    - Automatic rollback on degradation
    - Progressive traffic shifting
  
  Implementation:
    # Flagger configuration
    apiVersion: flagger.app/v1beta1
    kind: Canary
    metadata:
      name: backend
    spec:
      analysis:
        interval: 30s
        threshold: 5
        maxWeight: 50
        stepWeight: 10
        metrics:
        - name: request-success-rate
          thresholdRange:
            min: 99
          interval: 1m
        - name: request-duration
          thresholdRange:
            max: 500
          interval: 30s
```

### Pattern 3: Distributed Tracing Integration

```yaml
Tracing Architecture:
  Components:
    Application → OpenTelemetry SDK → OTEL Collector → Jaeger → Grafana
  
  Correlation:
    Logs ←→ Traces: Via trace_id in log messages
    Metrics ←→ Traces: Via exemplars in Prometheus
    
  Implementation:
    # Python example
    from opentelemetry import trace
    from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger import JaegerExporter
    
    tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
    
    @app.route('/api/order')
    def create_order():
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("create_order") as span:
            span.set_attribute("order.value", 100)
            # Your business logic
            logger.info("Order created", extra={"trace_id": span.get_span_context().trace_id})
```

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Black Friday Traffic Spike

```yaml
Problem: 10x traffic spike expected
Monitoring Strategy:
  Pre-Event:
    - Increase retention to capture baseline
    - Pre-scale monitoring infrastructure
    - Set up additional dashboards
    - Configure auto-scaling alerts
  
  During Event:
    - Real-time dashboard on TVs
    - 5-minute alert evaluation
    - Increased sampling rates
    - Live error budget tracking
  
  Post-Event:
    - Detailed analysis reports
    - Capacity planning updates
    - Runbook improvements
    - Cost analysis

Specific Queries:
  # Traffic spike detection
  rate(http_requests_total[1m]) > avg_over_time(rate(http_requests_total[5m])[1h:1m]) * 2
  
  # Auto-scaling trigger
  avg(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m])) > 0.7
```

### Scenario 2: Multi-Region Deployment

```yaml
Architecture:
  Region Setup:
    US-East-1:
      - Primary Prometheus
      - Thanos Sidecar
      - Full retention (90d)
    
    EU-West-1:
      - Secondary Prometheus
      - Thanos Sidecar
      - Medium retention (30d)
    
    AP-Southeast-1:
      - Edge Prometheus
      - Thanos Sidecar
      - Short retention (7d)
  
  Global View:
    - Thanos Query Frontend
    - Grafana Global Dashboards
    - Cross-region alerts

Implementation:
  # Thanos Query Configuration
  - id: us-east-1
    address: prometheus-us.example.com:10901
  - id: eu-west-1
    address: prometheus-eu.example.com:10901
  - id: ap-southeast-1
    address: prometheus-ap.example.com:10901
```

### Scenario 3: Compliance and Audit Requirements

```yaml
Requirements Mapping:
  GDPR:
    - PII redaction in logs
    - 30-day retention for user data
    - Audit trail of access
  
  SOC2:
    - Encrypted storage
    - Access controls
    - Change tracking
  
  HIPAA:
    - PHI encryption
    - 6-year retention
    - Access audit logs

Implementation:
  Log Pipeline:
    1. Ingestion → Fluentd
    2. PII Detection → Regex patterns
    3. Redaction → Replace with [REDACTED]
    4. Encryption → AES-256
    5. Storage → S3 with encryption
    6. Audit → CloudTrail integration
  
  # Fluentd PII filter
  <filter **>
    @type record_transformer
    <record>
      message ${record["message"].gsub(/\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b/i, "[EMAIL]")}
      message ${record["message"].gsub(/\b(?:\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4})\b/, "[SSN]")}
    </record>
  </filter>
```
